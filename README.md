# Fractal-Garden
Take care of your personal fractal garden!
Water the fractals to grow them and trim them down when needed. Fractals can be bent into beautiful shapes or repotted into wonderful pots.
Fractal Garden provides an experience that is both relaxing and fascinating.

This project was made for the Python programming course DD1331 at KTH in the fall of 2022.
